Project Tools

Software for doing multiscale modeling in the Clementi Lab at Rice University. 

Purpose:
--------

The purpose of this software is to make multiscale, combining coarse-grain and all-atom approaches, modeling easier. The intention is that project_tools will become a useful toolset for Clementi group members. It is intended to be used with a complementary module, model_builder, which is responsible for constructing simulation input files (e.g. Gromacs .gro and .top files)

Description:
------------

This package currently performs coarse-grain model parameter fitting as developed by Matysiak et.al.(ref. 1). 


How To Use this Module:
-----------------------

See the file Setting_Up_Davinci_Environment.txt for instructions on installing dependencies on the Rice University server Davinci. Be aware that these instructions may be outdated.
