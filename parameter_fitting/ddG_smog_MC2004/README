Prerequisites: 
- User calculates the f_ij^k with mutatepdbs.py
- User calculates the temperature normalized ddG with prepare_ddG.py
- Finish Equil_Tf_wham step
- User identifies state_bounds and deletes the temps not used  T_array_last.

Plan:
1. Compute feature vector and Jacobian in one step   -->         DONE
2. Invert and solve for new parameters in one step
1. MPI code for comuting the feature vector and Jacobian

Consider reducing/refactoring/removing:
- module_prepare_ddG, prepare_ddG
- branch
- flip_beadbead
- calcfij
