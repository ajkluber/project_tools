""" Submodule containing recipes for running specific algorithms.

Description:

    This submodule is called 'recipes' because it holds scripts to
automatically execute a set of steps to implement a specific algorithm. The
purpose of this submodule is ensure that procedures are easily reproduceable
and extendable to additional systems.


Available Recipes:

MatysiakClementi2004
    Implements procedure from reference (1) to get a heterogeneous Go-model.
    
FRETfit (coming soon)
    Implements algorithm to match a heterogeneous Go-model to FRET data.
